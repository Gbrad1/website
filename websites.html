          <h2>Fully functional website</h2>
          <p>I used Microsoft Visual Studio and ASP.NET to create a fully functional website with a few of my classmates.
            This website resembeled a mattress store that was entirely based online. 
            Users could create a login and use their login to order any of the items that were available on the site. 
            Using Microsoft Visual studio, we were able to assign roles within the user's login credentials. 
            For example, a page on the sight was equipped with every purchase that was made but was only accessible by someone with 
            a "manager" role.

          <h2>Survey website</h2>
          <p>For my senior project we were open to a wide variety of options. I had been working
            on creating websites using only HTML and CSS. I wanted to take it another step forward. 
            I did so by stating that I would create a prebuilt survey into the website and have the answers
            stored in a database using postgreSQL. Now I had never even taken a database class before
            so I knew this was going to be a challenge. I was able to setup the database onto one of the 
            computer science servers that was available at my University.

            <h2>The website you are on right now!</h2>
            <p>This website is the third version of my portfolio site. I had attempted previous versions by teaching myself
              HTML and CSS but the results were not satisfying at the time. This site is the newest version and is what I keep up to date.
